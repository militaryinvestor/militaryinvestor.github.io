Ok, most people don’t like to think about needing life insurance.  However, it is critical for 

Thinking about death makes many people uneasy, and it becomes really easy to pay for SGLI while you are in the military and the Veteran’s Group Life Insurance (VGLI) after you leave the military.  Having SGLI/VGLI is okay for the short term, but this strategy could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime.

Instead, before you separate from the military, I’d recommend getting quotes for Term Life insurance.

Types of Life Insurance

Term Life is simply insurance.  You request an insurance plan over a set number of years (i.e. 30 years).  During that time, you pay a monthly premium that doesn’t change.  In exchange, you get a death benefit that pays you a set amount (i.e. $500,000) if you die before your term is up.  However, if your term ends, so does your coverage.  Term is the simplest and cheapest option.  

Whole Life (a.k.a. Permanent Life Insurance) is very different.  They are sold as both insurance and an investment that accrues a cash balance over time.  However, Whole Life is *way* more expensive than Term life (like 10-15x as much), very complex, and usually charge extremely high fees.  However, they do build a tax-advantaged cash balance that could be best avenue for those in extremely high tax brackets.

There are dozens of types of whole life insurance.  Some provide variable returns (e.g. tracking the market, or some other method), while others guarantee a static return (e.g. 5%).

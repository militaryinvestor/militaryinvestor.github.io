**BLUF:** “Money Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing” by Gary Smith is an excellent book on value investing.  Though most of the explanations of why the principles in this book are important are easily accessible, the technical details of how to use equations to determine a stock's _intrinsic value_ were very, very hard to grasp when listening to the audiobook.

MONEY MACHINE

Stocks are a money machine that churn out dividend payments.  How much would you pay to get those dividend payments?

This is the opposite of speculators, who try to buy something only to sell it for a higher price to someone else (like crypto).  

Warren Buffett says, "my favorite holding period (for stocks) is forever."  Keeping that in mind changes how you view stocks. You buy stocks based on the cash they generate, not guesses on how their price will go up or down.

Value investors don't follow the news… the stock market is mostly efficient, and so any published information will already be factored into the stock's price.  Don't chase the news… instead look for good companies who are trading at a discount, then buy and hold them long term.

However, value investors believe the stock market isn’t completely efficient because investors influence each other.  Their shared error causes them to collectively overvalue or undervalue stocks, which creates both unsustainable market bubbles and  

Key points:
The stock markets are only semi-efficient.  Hype causes market bubbles that eventually pop.  Pessimism causes everyone to undervalue stocks, causing stocks to go on sale.
Bargains are not going to be found when investors are optimistic
“Buy when everyone else is selling, and hold until everyone else is buying.” - J. Paul Getty
Doing the opposite of what others are doing is a contrarian strategy
Technical Analysis of stock prices (i.e. looking at stock price charts to find patterns) cannot predict future stock prices… nothing can.
Precious metals are not a good value investment, as it doesn't generate income (it actually costs money to store and secure)

John C. Bogle: Estimate the implied rate of return w/ approx.
Stock return = dividend yield + annual growth of earnings + annual change in P/E

Forbes most admired companies

John burr Williams Jbw equation

R = ( D / P ) + g
Total annual Return. 
Annual Dividend
Current stock price
Annual rate of growth of Dividends

Available 5% growth rate (roughly rate of economy) 

Schiller cyclically adjusted price earning ratio

Available inflation adjusted earnings / inflation adjusted price of stock

Assumed 2.5% rate of inflation


Bogle model (over 10 yrs)

Stock return = dividend yield  + annual growth of earnings + annual change in P/E


Calculate present value of $1 in n years
Is $1 x 1/(1+r)*n where r is rate of return

Why Technical Analysis (looking at stock price charts to find patterns) doesn’t work:

Technical analysis is a rear-view mirror, not a crystal ball.  It shows you what happened, but does not show you what is going to happen………. Making it completely useless.

So when you see on reddit or Facbook that some pattern shows that prices are going up, ignore them.


Ignore "hot stock" tips.  If someone says a stock is definitely going to go up, ignore them.  They can't predict the future.  Think about stocks as "money machines" not as quick rich schemes.  Usually false.

Value investing is the secret to beating the market

Money machines.  Don't buy stocks at inflated prices with the intent of selling to a "greater fool" who's willing to pay more.  Instead think of stocks as money machines and think about what you'd be willing to pay for the cash (dividends) they generate over an indefinite time frame.

Markets are semi-efficient.  They are not 100% accurate in showing the stock's intrinsic value.  They reflect investor's expectations, not their true value.  

Value investors don’t try to predict dips in stock prices

Mr. Market is not always right.  Stock prices are sometimes driven by investor expectations, causing bubbles and dips that are not always based on the value of the stock itself.

During speculative booms and busts, the market “leaves briefcases of 100-dollar bills on the sidewalk.”  However, if you’ve found an easy way to make money, ask yourself if you’ve found something others haven’t found, or if there is a logical reason why

If price dips after, decide if it is due to the value also dropping.  If so, consider selling to harvest capital losses.  If not, consider buying at an even better price.

Processing information.  Think more clearly about things that are well known.  Prices may be distorted by common errors amoung the majority of investors.  Semi efficient.  

3 examples:
 Confusing a great company with a great stock
Hot tips
Chasing trends

Half of us are below average at picking stocks.  However, we often have more confidence in our picks than is warranted.

Even if random data, can find patterns (even where there aren't any).  If not underlying reason for the underlying pattern, the pattern will not persist.  Value Investors do not waste time looking for patterns as they don't predict the future of a stock.

High hopes.  

Swap dogecoin for capital gains (calculate my gains)... swap enough to nearly max capital gains.

Value investors are sellers during speculative bubbles and buyers during sell-offs

Intrinsic value is present value of dividends over indefinite horizon (vs trying to guess market prices) 

Market drivers are Profits and interest rates used to discount these prices.  

Companies that don't pay dividends can be valued using the Schiller Bogle and Eva models.  However don't like investing in companies that don't pay dividends.


Instead of trying to guess at future stock prices, Value Investors look for good companies with low stock prices relative to their dividends, earnings, and assets.  Use a contrarian strategy to do the opposite of what “the herd” is doing.  Stock prices are low when most investors are pessimistic, and high when they are happy.  Value investors buy when the market is down, and sell when the market is high.  

JBW equation - total return estimate (dividend yield + growth rate) can be compared vs. current treasury bonds interest rates + risk premium

Compare Schiller cyclically adjusted earning yeild to inflation adjusted 10-year treasury rate

Bogle method for estimating stock returns over a 10-year horizon.  Stock return = dividend yield + annual growth of earnings + annual change in P/E.  

Can be applied to market as a whole (S&P) or individual stocks.  Top 10 on Fortunes list of most admired companies have beat the S&P.  Focus on most admired and use these 3 models to assess if they are attractively priced.

Optimistic forecasts tend to be overly optimistic (and underperform other stocks).  


—-------------

Companies should own twice as much as they owe
Current assets vs current liabilities
(Compare against companies in same industry.)
Also check to see if ratio is getting worse or not
Quick method = same but also subtract inventory (if can't sell it)
Long term assets/real estate and debts, stocks, etc.  
Long term 

Should have a moat (protects against obsolescence) 

Earnings multiples
Earnings vs. debt
"Book value"
Avoid "Emerging Markets"
Track insider buying (CEOs/COOs/etc.)



Like most books I read, it is also available via the DoD’s MWR library (on the Libby app) or can be bought on Amazon.

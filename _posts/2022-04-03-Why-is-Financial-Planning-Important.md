*Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):* Creating a financial plan for your family is a crucial step in creating goals for creating and protecting wealth.  Without a plan, you are unlikely to know whether you are headed towards success.  Also, it is harder to stick to your investing plan if you haven't solidified why you made those choices.   

-------

There is an old saying about project management... "Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance."  This is also true with family financial planning.

For the first 80% of my military career, I thoroughly ignored my financial situation.  We put myself in debt, only invested a little in the Thrift Savings Plan each month, and basically plodded along without any goal or aim in mind.  As a result, I found myself behind where I wanted to be financially.

Somewhat recently, I finally began to take my finances seriously.  I decided that I wanted to be debt-free in the short term.  I decided that I didn't want to rely on just my military retirement and social security to pay the bills when I finally retire.  After realizing that I needed to step up my investments to get there, I decided that I would start investing at least 15% of my income.  I began learning more and realized that I could increase my returns by using smart tax planning.

###Step 1. Figure out your situation.

Start by making a list of all the financial parts of your life.  This list should include:
- Your income (how much you get paid each month, and if you are expecting any changes in income)
- List your bills (house, cars, utilities, internet, streaming services, insurance, etc.)
- List your assets (your house's value, amount in your bank accounts & investment accounts, etc.)
- List your debts (home loan, car loans, credit cards, etc.)

This information will be important for planning.  However, once you are done, move on to step 2.

###Step 2. Figure out your financial goals.

Planning your finances requires starting with the end in mind.  Ask yourself: 
- Long-Term: How do I want to retire?  
- Short-Term: How do I want my finances to look in the next 2-3 years?

Long Term:
For example, I wanted to ensure we accumulated enough investments by retirement age (~30 years) to receive $40,000/year in today's dollars.  My goal is modest, but reasonable since I started very late.  Also, because I should have my military retirement, our family should be comfortable with this amount.

####Step 2A. Find your magic number (i.e. how much you need to live off 3% of your investments per year)

The Math:
Figuring out your goal number requires a little math.  Here are the steps:
1. How much money do you need each year to live on?
2. Multiply by 33 (to find your _magic number_, or how much you need to accumulate by retirement).  
3. Adjust your magic number for inflation (by adding a compounding 3%/year, or estimating with the Rule of 72)

For example, for my $40,000 goal:
1. I needed $40,000 (in today's dollars)
2. I multiplied by 33x, giving me a total of $1,320,000
3. If I plan to retire by 65 years old, I have 25 years to retire.  At 3%/year, I'd expect the amount I need to double in 27 years.  If I'm retiring in 25 years, I'd say we'd need about $2,600,000 to retire.

####Step 2B. How much do I need to invest each month to meet my goal?

So, with my magic number of $2,600,000 I can use an [investing calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/investment-calculator) to determine how much I need to invest each month to meet my goal.  If I was starting from $0, it would take investing $3,300/month (assuming a 7% return) to reach this goal in 25 years.  Because I'm not starting from about $100,000, I will need to invest ~$2,600/month. 

####Step 2C. What investments should I use to get there?

To ensure that you have the maximum tax-free returns, you must also think about what types of accounts (like Roth IRAs, TSP, or 401Ks) you will use for your investments.  If you are eligible (based on income), I'd start with maxing out a Roth IRA for you and your spouse (if applicable) with $6,000/year for each of you.  Then, if eligible, put the rest in your Roth TSP (or Roth 401K) up to your total monthly investment goal.

Why?  Because, these tax-advantaged accounts will help you keep more of your investment gains over the long-term.  In addition, Roth IRAs have the neat feature of allowing you to pull out the money you put in (_contributions_) at any time (but not the investment gains), if needed.  

For my wife and I, we are able to invest $12,000/year in Roth IRAs (using a _Spousal IRA_ for her) and put the rest of our investments in our Roth TSP (while I'm still in the military).  


Short Term: 
For example, I decided that I wanted to be debt-free (except our mortgage), and to sell our money-losing rental property.  I wanted to create investing accounts and be on my way to my retirement goals.  


Short Term:
For example, when I started getting serious about my finances, I decided that I wanted to be debt-free (except our mortgage) and have sold our money-losing rental property.  I also wanted to get where I was investing 15% of my income upfront and then maxing out our tax-advantaged investment accounts each year (2x Roth IRAs at $6,000 each, and Roth TSP at $20,500).  Also, as I'm transitioning from the military, I wanted to have new life insurance (for after my military retirement).

Let’s face facts.  If you are in the military, you probably don’t have enough saved for retirement.  If you’re enlisted, that’s doubly true.  With rare exceptions, many enlisted members have only minimal savings, and are definitely not investing enough to build a comfortable retirement.  I get it… you have bills to pay, and we have a good retirement pension ahead of us.  Isn’t that enough to retire on?

No.  No it really isn’t.

For the most part, your military retirement is a good pension, but will roughly pay for a decent mortgage.  It will be significantly lower that your take home pay now – only starting at 50% of your base pay at 20 years (not including your BAH or BAS entitlements).  You’ll need other income (i.e. retirement investments or other income) to make sure you can afford to live through retirement.

In general, most Americans between 55-65 have saved an average of $160,000 for retirement.  Is this enough?  Definitely not when you realize that this money has to last you for maybe 10-30 years.  Even with a military pension (which usually pays for a decent mortgage if you retire) and if social security is still around when you are older, would you be able to live on $5,300 dollars a year?  Probably not.

The commonly cited rule of thumb is that you should only spend 3-4% of your nest egg each year in retirement.  The thought is that your nest egg will continue to grow (if invested well) and you won’t run out of money.  

So, if you have $1,000,000, then you can spend $30,000 to $40,000 each year in retirement.  Not a lot for having a million bucks… right?

Worse, inflation (which has averaged about 3% over time) makes every dollar worth less every year.  $1,000,000 in cash will be able to buy only $860,000 in 10 years, $680,000 in 20 years, and a measly $520,000 in 30 years!  Your money will probably buy half as much in 30 years… so you’ll need to double your financial goal to get the same spending power.  

In the example of $1,000,000, your $30,000 to $40,000 per year will likely be worth only $15,000 to $20,000 worth in today’s dollars.  A comfortable retirement that does not make.

And, you’ll also have to account for taxes, which, if you are not using a after-tax retirement plan like a Roth IRA or Roth TSP, will cost you another percentage.  There are ways to help save on taxes, but it requires planning.

Though traditional advice is that you’ll need less money when you retire.  But, will you really?  In Jill Schlesinger’s book, “The Dumb Things That Smart People Do With Their Money”, she talks about the pitfalls to this kind of thinking.  When you get used to living a certain type of lifestyle, it is extremely hard to cut back.  It usually takes a catastrophic event – like suddenly running out of retirement savings – to force people to drastically change their habits… often to a painful level.  Unless you want this to be your future, you should be investing in your retirement now.

I don’t throw all this out to scare anyone.  But, just relying on just your military retirement (if you plan on retiring) will not be enough for you or your family.

So, how much do you have saved and invested?  If you don’t have a plan to build enough wealth to protect your future… you have work to do.  Keep reading and start investing smartly.

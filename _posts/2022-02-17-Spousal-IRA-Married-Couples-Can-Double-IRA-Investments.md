*Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):* If you are married and your spouse doesn't work (and you file taxes jointly), you can _both_ invest in IRAs or Roth IRAs.  This means, your family can invest $6,000/year in your IRA, and $6,000/year in your spouse's IRA!  

-------

Many military households are single-income, where the service member is the sole breadwinner.  If you fall into this situation, did you know that your spouse can still invest up to $6,000/year in their own IRA or Roth IRA?

#### As a Recap, what is an IRA?

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is an investment account that is tax advantaged where you can invest $6,000/year.  When you invest money in a traditional IRA, you receive a tax refund (but you pay taxes later).  When you invest in a Roth IRA, you invest money you've already paid taxes on, but your investments grow tax free.  Both are retirement accounts designed to let your money grow in a tax-advantaged way until you are retirement age.

For more info, read this post [about the differences between IRAs and Roth IRAs](https://www.militaryinvestor.org/IRA-vs-Roth-IRA/).


#### What is a Spousal IRA?

A Spousal IRA allows you to invest up to $6,000/year in your spouse's IRA retirement account, even if they do not have any income.  So, if you spouse is a stay-at-home parent, they can still invest $6,000/year in their account.  At the same time, you can still invest another $6,000/year in your account.  

To invest in a Spousal IRA, your family must file your taxes as "married filing jointly".

#### Can a Spousal IRA be a Roth IRA?

Yes.  You can create a Roth IRA for your Spouse.  This allows you to invest money in your spouse's Roth IRA and let those investments grow tax-free.  Because most military members are in lower tax brackets, investing in Roth IRAs can help you reduce your total tax bill by thousands over your lifetime!

#### Why does this matter?

*If you opt to create a Spousal IRA for your spouse, then your household can invest up to $12,000/year in IRAs* - $6,000/year for you, and $6,000/year for your spouse - instead of just $6,000/year.  

This increases the total amount of money you can invest in tax-advantaged accounts, maximizing your family's ability to increase wealth.  

#### How do I create a Spousal IRA?

A Spousal IRA is just a regular IRA.  However, it must be created under your spouse's name.  You can open an IRA the same way you did yours, such as with [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/), [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home), or [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/).

You'll likely have to create it in a separate account (with a separate login) for your spouse.

My original Wordpress-based website imploded. However, this outage has given me some time to re-assess the content I was writing, and I've decided to re-write my previous posts to make them easier to understand.  I really want to speak to people who don't understand investing (yet), but also provide technical details for those who are interested.    

I'm also migrating this site and its content over to Github Pages, which should be much more reliable. Expect that shiny, edited content will be available by the first of the year.

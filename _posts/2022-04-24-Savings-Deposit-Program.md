*Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):* The Savings Deposit Program (SDP) allows deployed military members to get a guaranteed 10% annual return on their deployed pay (up to $10,000 total).  

Today, I want to briefly cover a special program for deployed military members (active duty, and guard/reserves on active orders): the Savings Deposit Program (SDP).  This program allows you to invest up to 100% of your monthly pay while deployed and receive a **[guaranteed 10% APR return](https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/sdp/#:~:text=SDP%20Interest%20compounds%20monthly%20and,accrue%20interest.)** on your investment.  

--------------

### Eligibility Requirements:
- You must be Active Duty, or Guard/Reserves on active orders
- You must be deployed to: [(1) a designated combat zone OR (2) receiving **Hostile Fire Pay (HFP) or Imminent Danger Pay (IDP)  in a Qualified Hazardous Duty Area (QHDA) or designated direct support area of a combat zone](https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/sdp/#:~:text=The%20DoD%20Savings%20Deposit%20Program%20(SDP)%20was%20established%20to%20provide,of%20a%20combat%20zone.).

------------

### Limitations & Conclusion:
- You must be deployed for [30 consecutive days, or 1 day in 3 consecutive months](https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/sdp/#:~:text=After%20a%20member%20has%20served,qualified%20to%20begin%20making%20deposits.) to start investing. 
- You only [earn interest for 90 days after you return from deployment](https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/sdp/#:~:text=Upon%20returning%20from%20deployment%2C%20deposits,to%2090%20days.).  
- You [cannot withdraw funds deposited until after you return from deployment](https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/sdp/#:~:text=When%20a%20member%20contributes%20to,returning%20from%20deployment.), with a few exceptions.  Usually, [your money will be returned to you 120 days after you return from deployment](https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/sdp/#:~:text=An%20SDP%20account%20payment%2C%20including,left%20the%20combat%20zone.)

However, despite these limitations, there are few investments in existence that guarantee a 10% return.  If you are deployed and have the money available, using this program beats the average return of the stock market (~7-8%), but without the volatility.  

--------------

### Conclusion:
If you deploy, investing the maximum amount you are allowed - as early as you are allowed - into SDP is a smart financial play.  In addition, since your money continues to draw 10% interest for 90 days after you return from deployment, I'd also suggest leaving your money in at least that long.  

The SDP is a benefit.  If you can, use it.

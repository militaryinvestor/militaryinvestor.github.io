## Military Investor

My original Wordpress-based website imploded.  However, this outage has given me some time to re-assess the content I was providing, and I've decided to re-write my previous posts to make them easier to understand.  

I'm migrating this site and its content over to Github Pages, which should make the site much more reliable.  Expect that shiny, edited content will be available by the first of the year.
